# Playground: Coding Problems & Patterns

This repository contains a collection of coding problems, data structures, algorithms, and design pattern implementations. It is organized for learning, practicing, and reference purposes.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph, Heap, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Bubble, Heap, Insertion, Merge), Searching, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, and others.
- **Design Patterns**: Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, and more.
- **Problem Solutions**: Classic and interview-style problems (e.g., Two Sum, LRU Cache, Add Two Numbers, Palindrome, Valid Number, Word Break, etc.).
- **Project Euler**: Solutions to selected Project Euler problems.
- **Educative Patterns**: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Heaps, Queues, and Two Pointers patterns from popular learning platforms.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - Source code for problems, data structures, and patterns
- `bin/` - Compiled classes and resource files
- `docs/` - Documentation and problem overviews
- `build/`, `libs/`, `target/` - Build artifacts and dependencies

## Example Problem Categories

- **Array & String Manipulation**: e.g., Longest Substring, License Key Formatting
- **Linked List Problems**: e.g., Add Two Numbers, Merge Lists
- **Stack & Queue Problems**: e.g., MinStack, Parentheses Validation
- **Dynamic Programming**: e.g., Decode Ways, Word Break
- **Math & Logic**: e.g., Palindrome, Smallest Positive Integer
- **Graph & Tree Problems**: e.g., Siblings, Tree Traversals
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations in `bin/main/designpattern/`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build with Gradle: `./gradlew build`
3. Run tests or individual classes as needed.
